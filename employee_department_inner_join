Given two DataFrames — employees and departments — perform an inner join on department_id and select employee name and department name.

from pyspark.sql.types import *
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Employees DataFrame
employees_data = [
    (1, "John", 101),
    (2, "Alice", 102),
    (3, "Bob", 101),
    (4, "Charlie", 103)
]

employees_columns = ["employee_id", "employee_name", "department_id"]

employees_df = spark.createDataFrame(employees_data, employees_columns)

# Departments DataFrame
departments_data = [
    (101, "HR"),
    (102, "Engineering"),
    (103, "Marketing")
]

departments_columns = ["department_id", "department_name"]

departments_df = spark.createDataFrame(departments_data, departments_columns)

employee_department_df = employees_df.join(departments_df, on = employees_df.department_id == departments_df.department_id, how ='inner' ).select("employee_name", "department_name")

display(employee_department_df)
